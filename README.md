# Advice for New Researcher
A.K.A. _1337SEARCH_

> Feynman was once asked by a Caltech faculty member to explain why spin 1/2 particles obey
Fermi-Dirac statistics. He gauged his audience perfectly and said, "I’ll prepare a
freshman lecture on it." But a few days later he returned and said, "You know, I couldn’t
do it. I couldn’t reduce it to the freshman level. That means we really don’t understand it."

Trying to explain idea(s) to those less familiar provides an effective litmus test on a researcher's
understanding of the subject and the present depth of knowledge.

  <sup>&dagger;</sup>
  These sections take a more academic approach to research; needless to say,
  it presumes significant dedication in both time and interest.

## Additions to include
- [ ] Expand upon scoping and the transition between _research research research_ and _do the work_ (touch upon the time-estimations)
- [ ] Detail more info, specific to CS Security; papers are great for cypto and novel stuff, but knowing how to e.g., scrape github repos for closed-source
  info or leverage targeted web searches, would greatly ease the transition for those unfamiliar - you won't find the RE'd M1 architecture on arxiv...


## Who is Research For?
**EVERYONE!** No...seriously..._everyone can do it_

- Research should facilitate what the researcher(s) already enjoy! 
- Research does **not** need to be this arduous and/or rigorous thing; _it should always steer
  towards interest_, ideally with a target goal - whatever that may be.  
  
  It can be as simple as dedicated time - time, specifically carved out of our busy lives, that
  we can dedicate to something we (the researcher) find intellecually stimulating, e.g.,:
  - I want to do course X, but it [_costs too must_ | _isn't being offered_ | _moves too fast_ | _would be more benificial from self-direction_ | _etc._]
  - I see gap Y in field A, I think I can [_fill it_ | _contribute to it_ | _learn why it is a gap_ | _learn how to teach others about the gap_ | _etc._]
  - I want to pwn this thing, but need/want [_dedicated time_ | _a pwnpartner_ | _hardware-software resources_ | _etc._]

### Novel vs Applied
_TODO: Expand on the dichotomoy of Novel v. Applied Research_

- Both are _proper_ research
- Novel research perspectives often rely more on cutting edge journals and publications
- Applied research perspectives may rely on cutting edge publications, but often
  involves more active work by the research in both experimentation and investigation 

### Collaboration
_TODO: Expand on collaboration in security._

- value of individual work
- value of collab/group work

## Characteristics of the Ideal Research Topic
The characteristics of an ideal topic are, to some extent, incompatible:

- **The subject should be timely.**
  Previous groundwork should leave your research problem ripe for completion,
  and it should be in an active area with potential for future work and
  employment.
        
  On the other hand, if a field is too crowded, and the subject too prominent,
  then you risk being "scooped" by a more experienced researcher who is
  able to work faster than you. In this case, you may be forced to start over
  again (rather disastrous) or at least publish jointly (possibly a blessing,
  but surely an inconvenience).


- **Your work should lead to a well-defined set of results to which you can lay claim.**
  In particular, career prospects will be lessoned if you merely
  contribute a small piece of a very large project, a piece of software which
  is closely identified with a project, or is published with a long list of
  collaborators.
 
  On the other hand, it is impossible to work in a vacuum, and your task
  can be significantly harder if you don't have a group of people working on
  closely related problems with whom you can interact and share code.


- **The best topics show a high level of creativity -- and are often somewhat speculative.**
  It is often unclear at first how the ideas will develop.

  On the other hand, a multiyear plan of research is a very valuable asset.


- **You should really enjoy the subject, and want to spend the next several
  weeks/months/years with it!**
      
  On the other hand, an ideal subject in a foreign subject is of no use without
  someone(s) who is willing to direct you in it.
  
_Clearly some compromise is necessary here!_

## How Do I Find Research Ideas?
### Active Learning
It's very important to make the transition from the passive mode of learning
that traditional lecture courses encourage to an active, and critical, learning style.

Whenever you read technical material, evaluate a piece of software, or listen to
a research talk, ask yourself these canonical questions:

- From where did the author seem to draw the ideas?
- What exactly was accomplished by this piece of work?
- How does it seem to relate to other work in the field?
- What would be the reasonable next step to build upon this work?
- What questions are left unanswered?
- What are the important references cited by this work?
- What ideas from related fields might be brought to bear upon this subject?
- Can the results be generalized?

One technique that some find helpful is to keep a written log of your technical
reading and listening. Review it periodically to see if some of the ideas begin
to fit together.

Similarly, keep a sheaf of small projects on paper. These are one or two pages of
formally presented ideas on a single subject. When ideas are not allowed to get out
and wander about they become malformed and misaligned. These writeups keep the pencil
sharp and serve to organize spontaneous ideas. Having these available at a moment’s
notice pays off when one begins to seriously look for research projects.

#### Research Power Hour
A “journal club” provides an excuse for engineers to meet [bi-]weekly to discuss papers. Focus
could be on a topic (e.g., _“The Month of Garbage Collection”_), but allow for digression when
a common interest develops.

#### Remaining Active
Even after you have decided on your initial focus, it is important to continue a
routine of reading new journals and technical reports and attending seminars.
All of these sources can contribute to the development of your idea.

At this stage you can add one question to the canonical list: _How can these
ideas help me solve my research problem?_

#### A Pitfall to Avoid
It is possible to spend almost all of your time in literature review and seminars.
It is easy to convince yourself that by doing this you are working hard and
accomplishing something. _The truth of the matter is that nothing will come of
it unless you're an active reader and listener, and unless you assign yourself
time to develop your own ideas, too._ It is impossible to "finish a literature
review and then start research." New literature is always appearing, and as
your depth and breadth increases, you will continually see new connections and
related areas that must be studied.

Active listening and reading must be viewed as "education" that will involve you
for the rest of your career. Don't fool yourself into thinking it must be finished
before you can begin research.

### Exposing Yourself to Research
Set aside some time every week/month for trying to generate research ideas. Some
possible catalysts are:

- Make a monthly investigation to read, at least, the recent abstracts from the
  premier journals in your field. Choose an article or two to read in depth
  and critique.
- Make a weekly investigation to find technical reports in your field. Read selectively and critique.
- Pick a random DEFCON/BH/CCC/etc., talk or series. Listen and critique.

Add these to your log, and ask the canonical questions. As you review the
log six months from now, you may find something that stroke a chord then, but
is beyond you now. 

### Developing the Germ of an Idea
Once you have identified a topic that looks feasible, make sure you are aware of
all of the literature in the area. Keep reading and listening, and keep distinct
in your mind what is di erent between your work and others. If you do not
frequently review the literature you read months ago, you may nd yourself
unconsciously claiming credit for other people's ideas.

On the other hand, don't let other people's frame of mind limit your creativity. Make a
list of open problems and possible projects that are of interest to you, and discuss
them with potential advisors.

## The Project
Research in computer science often leads to a “project” involving programming. It's
important to remember that programming is not computer science research. Instead, for
most computer scientists, programming is merely a mechanism for performing an experiement.
As with any experiment, it should be carefully planned, ahead of time:

- **Establish goals.** Know where you are headed, and approach the solution without
  distraction. Develop a list of milestones which demonstrate progress, and strive to
  accomplish them. If you cannot formulate concise goals, you should stop and reconsider the
  motivations for the project.

- **Think simple.** Design your projects so that they may be completed within a reasonable
  period of time. An experienced programmer generates little more than a hundred lines of
  reliable code per month. A project that demands thousands of lines of code, therefore, will
  take more than a couple of two-week blocks to implement correctly. Time spent pruning the
  experiment to a manageable size is time well spent. Large projects do not necessarily yield
  large results.

- **Build prototypes.** Most projects benefit from the construction of a prototype. A well
  considered prototype validates assumptions, tests the value of abstractions, and motivates
  reconsideration of weak ideas. While there is little research value associated with polishing
  off a “product,” many research questions can be answered satisfactorily through mock-ups
  or partial implementations.

- **Use tools.** A programmer’s performance is dramatically improved through the use of a
  few simple tools. There are, of course, many important and useful tools, but the main point
  is clear: _the correct choice of tools can reduce the total work in a project._ Find them,
  learn from them, and use them.

- **Collaborate.** When resources can be coordinated, groups are often more productive than
  individual efforts in isolation. If you share research interests with others, contact them and
  collaborate. Undoubtedly they will have solved problems you are currently considering, and their
  solutions will influence how you achieve common goals.

  _One side effect of collaboration is increased discipline, discipline that is necessary to reduce
  the amount of energy expended synchronizing efforts._

- **Document results.** Finished projects should be documented. At a minimum, a technical
  overview of the experiment allows others to see what motivates your research. The
  document should describe the problem, your assumptions, your approach, and an honest
  evaluation of your results. When documenting software, include illustrative examples,
  tutorials, and any experience gained from its use. Well written documentation greatly
  increases the impact of a project.
