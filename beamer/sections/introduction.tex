%Feynman was once asked by a Caltech faculty member to explain why spin 1/2 particles obey Fermi-Dirac statistics. He gauged his audience perfectly and said, "I’ll prepare a freshman lecture on it." But a few days later he returned and said, "You know, I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t reduce it to the freshman level. That means we really don’t understand it."

        Research can be made more enjoyable and productive through a little organization.\vspace{1.5em}

        For many, research techniques are a product of experience rather than, unfortunately, formal training.\vspace{1.5em}

        To improve this experience, we've provided several suggestions; it's the hope these suggestions
        ease some of the confusions faced when beginning a research project.
