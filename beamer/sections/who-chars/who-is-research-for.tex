    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Research should facilitate what the researcher already enjoys!}\vspace{1.5em}%
        \item Research should be fun! It does \textbf{not} need to be arduous and/or rigorous, rather \textit{it should always steer
            towards interest}, ideally with a target goal -- whatever that may be.\vspace{1em}%
            
            It can be as simple as dedicated time -- time, specifically carved out of our busy lives, that 
            we can dedicate to something we (the researcher) find intellectually stimulating.%, e.g.,:

\begin{frame}{The `Good' Researcher}

    \begin{center}
        Being a good research involves more than `merely' positing brilliant ideas and implementing them.\vspace{2em}%
    \end{center}

    Most researchers spend the majority of their time:\vspace{1em}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item reading papers\vspace{0.5em}
        \item listening to talks\vspace{0.5em}
        \item discussing ideas with others\vspace{0.5em}
        \item writing and revising papers\vspace{0.5em}
        \item staring blankly into space\vspace{0.5em}
        \item \small{and, of course, having brilliant ideas and implementing them}\vspace{0.5em}

\begin{frame}{Novel vs Applied}
%If you have an interest it it, you can research it. The only limits are those self-ascribed.
%For sake of explaination, we've chosen to divide the topic into applied research and novel research

\textbf{Applied Research:} \textit{I want to gain/share/discover knowledge}\vspace{0.5em}
\begin{itemize}
    \item May rely on cutting edge publications
    \item Often involves more active work by the researcher in both \textit{experimentation} and \textit{investigation}, e.g.: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item git[hub/lab] repo scraping 
            \item targeted web searches, specific to a [sub]domain, timeline, application, and other
                targeted web searches (use more than one search engine)
            \item reverse engineering a closed-source technology
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}\vspace{2em}

\textbf{Novel Research:} \textit{I want to create/contribute/posit this new knowledge}\vspace{0.5em}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Often rely more on cutting edge journals and publications
    \item Ideas, initally, tend to be more \textit{speculative} and difficult to explain
\end{itemize}

%Note: Neither form of research is \textit{better} than the other. They are simply
%different approaches, with their own brilliant ideas
