\begin{frame}{A Pitfall to Avoid}
  It is possible to spend almost all of your time in literature review and seminars.\\

  It is easy to convince yourself that by doing this you are working hard and
  accomplishing something. The truth of the matter is that nothing will come of
  it unless your are an active reader and listener and unless you assign yourself
  time to develop your own ideas, too. It is impossible to `finish a literature
  review and then start research.' New literature is always appearing, and as
  your depth and breadth increases, you will continually see new connections and
  related areas that must be studied. Active listening and reading must be viewed
  as `education' that will involve you for the rest of your career.\\

  Don't fool yourself into thinking it must be finished before you can begin research.
