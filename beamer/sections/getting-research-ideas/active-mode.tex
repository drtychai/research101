\begin{frame}{Active Readering and Listening}
  It is very important to make the transition from the passive mode of learning
  that traditional lecture courses encourage to an active and critical learning style.
  Whenever you read technical material, evaluate a piece of software, or listen to
  a research talk, ask yourself these canonical questions:

  \begin{itemize}
    \uncover<1->{
      \item{From where did the author seem to draw the ideas?}
    } 
    \uncover<2->{
      \item{What exactly was accomplished by this piece of work?}
    } 
    \uncover<3->{
      \item{How does it seem to relate to other work in the field?}
    }
    \uncover<4->{
      \item{What would be the reasonable next step to build upon this work?}
    }
    \uncover<5->{
      \item{What ideas from related elds might be brought to bear upon this subject?}
    }
  \end{itemize}

  One technique that some find helpful is to keep a written log of your technical
  reading and listening. Review it periodically to see if some of the ideas begin
  to fit together.
